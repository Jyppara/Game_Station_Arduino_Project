    Starting the project.
    Wiring ready.
    First testing the wiring with a template code. Push button isn't reacting. LCD is working fine.
    Pushbutton wiring fixed. Template code works perfectly.
    Testing LCD screen functionality with own test code.
    Pushbutton state stays HIGH even when not pushing the button, but keeping finger close to it.
    10k pull down resistor fixed the issue.
    Started coding the first game: Space Ship- game.
    First game has now one moving asteroid and the spaceship.
    Game stops when the asteroid hits the spaceship and displays the score on the Game Over- screen.
    Code is not organized properly yet.

    Added y-axis movement to asteroid to make the game more difficult.
    Also the asteroid keeps getting faster as the player get more points.
    Having issues uploading program to the Arduino.
    "avrdude: stk500_recv(): programmer is not responding".

    Restaring the computer and changing the USB port fixed the uploading issue.
    Fixed the issue when the asteroid never changed side completely, only flashed on the other row.
    Modified the spaceship and the asteroid with own character styles so they look more gamish.
    Reformatting code. Added .cpp and .h file for the first game. Making functions and variable
    names more informative. Adding comments where necessary. Cleaning code.
    Added a "Development" branch to repository for easier development version control.
    Added game_station.cpp/.h files for shared variables and functions.
    Started developing a new game: Tower Stack- game.
    Implemented a start screen and a menu for choosing a game to be played.
    Fixed issue where pressing the button for a long time generated unexpected behaviour.
    Now when asked to press the button the program waits until the button is released.

    Made the tower chars to the Tower Stack- game. 
    Made some code relocationing where shared functions between games are only in one file.
    Infinite stacking implemented and score is visible to the player.
    The tower stack is now graphically logical.
    Basic logic of the game is now finised.
    Made the score number to avoid the row where the tower block
    is moving so it won't affect the gaming experience by blocking the view.

26/9/2023

    Added increasing difficulty by moving the block faster as the player progresses in the game
    Made the block start at a random x-axis location each time so the game wouldn't be so predictable.
    Now the game flashes the game components when player loses.
    Tower Stack- game ready. Code splitted into logical functions.

27/9/2023

    Changed to bigger breadboard. Added a green LED to breadboard.
    Added green led blink to both games. When player gets a point green led flashes.
    Added potentiometer so player can dim the LED or completely shut it off if he wants.
    Started developing a new game; Reaction- game that counts the time
    when the LED lights up and the player pushes the button.
    Fixed an issue where choosing a game and holding the button for too long.
    Now every game starts after the player has released the button.
    Reaction time logic implemented to the new game.

28/9/2023

    Reaction game ready. The game lets the player try three times and keeps
    track of the scores. At the end of the rounds the game displays the best
    reaction time and the average reaction time.
    Added more comments and descriptions to the different files.

29/9/2023

    Added an animation to the tower stack game. Also changed the tower blocks to have windows.

30/9/2023

    Start coding a new game: Memory- game. Added potentiometer and capacitor to be used in the game.
    Mapped the potentiometer value to match the LCD. 
    Now the potentiometer works as a gaming controller.

1/10/2023

    Now the game prints the amount of cards to two rows and in the middle of the screen.
    Printing the cards one by one makes the last printed card flicker too much.
    Taking lcd.clear() out of the loop fixed the flickering.
    The cards stay at the same location so no need to clear the lcd.
    Added a starting animation where cards are set to the screen.
