    Starting the project.
    Wiring ready.
    First testing the wiring with a template code. Push button isn't reacting. LCD is working fine.
    Pushbutton wiring fixed. Template code works perfectly.
    Testing LCD screen functionality with own test code.
    Pushbutton state stays HIGH even when not pushing the button, but keeping finger close to it.
    10k pull down resistor fixed the issue.
    Started coding the first game: Space Ship- game.
    First game has now one moving asteroid and the spaceship.
    Game stops when the asteroid hits the spaceship and displays the score on the Game Over- screen.
    Code is not organized properly yet.

    Added y-axis movement to asteroid to make the game more difficult.
    Also the asteroid keeps getting faster as the player get more points.
    Having issues uploading program to the Arduino.
    "avrdude: stk500_recv(): programmer is not responding".

    Restaring the computer and changing the USB port fixed the uploading issue.
    Fixed the issue when the asteroid never changed side completely, only flashed on the other row.
    Modified the spaceship and the asteroid with own character styles so they look more gamish.
    Reformatting code. Added .cpp and .h file for the first game. Making functions and variable
    names more informative. Adding comments where necessary. Cleaning code.
