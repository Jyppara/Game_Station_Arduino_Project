# Game Station Arduino Project

GameStation project for Arduino Uno R3 with a 2x16 LCD screen and some basic electronic components.
GameStation is a gaming device that allows the user play different games on a single device.
Goals for this project is to learn more about programming microcontrollers and getting
more familiar of using basic electronic components such as LCD, LEDs, resistors, potentiometer
and piezo. <br>
## Games programmed so far:
1. TOWER STACK - game<br>
2. SPACESHIP - game<br>
## Circuit description:
Circuit has one **push button** which is for navigating through games and playing them.
Green **LED** is for blinking every time the player makes another point. With the **potentiometer**
the player can dim the **LED** or turn it off completely if he/she wants to do so.
**Piezo** is for making a "Game Over" sound whenever the player looses the game.
