# Game Station Arduino Project

GameStation project for Arduino Uno R3 with a 2x16 LCD screen and some basic electronic components.
GameStation is a gaming device that allows the user play different games on a single device.
Goals for this project is to learn more about programming microcontrollers and getting
more familiar of using basic electronic components such as LCD, LEDs, resistors, potentiometer
and piezo. <br>
## Games programmed so far:
1. TOWER STACK - game<br>
Got a steady hand like an architect? Now it's your time to build the tallest tower ever seen!
With presicion and fast fingers you'll be stacking blocks on top of each other by pushing
the button.
2. SPACESHIP - game<br>
Avoid the asteroids to stay alive! Move your spaceship with the push button to avoid
incoming asteroids. Beware as the asteroids may move unprecidtably and fast as a bullet.
3. REACTION -game<br>
You say you're fast? Let's see how fast you really are! Just push the button as soon
as you can see the LED light up. You must be consistant because you get three tries
and the average speed counts too!
## Circuit description:
Circuit has one **push button** which is for navigating through games and playing them.
Green **LED** is for blinking every time the player makes another point. With the **potentiometer**
the player can dim the **LED** or turn it off completely if he/she wants to do so.
**Piezo** is for making a "Game Over" sound whenever the player looses the game.
