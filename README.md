# Game_Station_Arduino_Project

Game station project for Arduino Uno with 2x16 LCD screen and a pushbutton.
Goals for this project is to create a gaming station that can be used to play
different games. The first game is a space themed game where the
player will have to avoid asteroids by moving the spaceship up and down.
Other games will be added as soon as they are programmed and tested.
